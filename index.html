	<h2> Pre-requisites: </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> A Philips-head screwdriver </li>
		<li> A large flat work area </li>
		<li> Minimum 8GB install USB </li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Step-by-step guide: </h2>

		<h3> <li> Disassembling the Case </li> </h3>
		The First thing you will need to do is removing the side panels of the case. Make sure you keep the panels and their accompanying screws in a safe place. At this point you may also want to take out the Hard Drive cage if not needed, to make fittment of the psu and its cables easier later. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing case Fans </li> </h3>
		If fans are not already installed or you have purchased extras, screw them into the case in the appropriate layout. Make sure the fans are orientated correctly, intaking or exhausting air where needed. Typically the direction that air is blown is indicated on the fan shroud. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Processor </li> </h3>
		Now it is time to prepare the Motherboard. We can first start by installing our processor (CPU). To do this simply pull up the retention arm then lift up the bracket on Intel and Ryzen 7000+ Motherboards. Then Line up the cpu in the right orientation and drop it into place (DO NOT APPLY ANY PRESSURE!). To know if it is in the right orientation check to see if the golden triangle on the bottom left of the cpu matches with that on the motherboard. Then slide the bracket back into its original position so it locks in place underneath the clip, and secure the retention arm back down. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Memory </li> </h3>
		Next we will have to install our memory. First push down the latches on either side of the DDR slot. Then line up your RAM and make sure the divot in the middle and the notch on the motherboard allign. Carefully push down the RAM into the slot until you hear a click meaning that it has been secured, and the latches have closed. <p> If you are not installing memory into every slot into the motherboard, make sure you consult your motherboards manual to see which slots to populate. Failing to do this may result in you not putting the memory in the correct slots and your system failing to boot. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Storage Drive </li> </h3>
		After that we install our M.2 NVME SSD. First make sure there are no screws already screwed down in the SSD posts. Then simply slide the SSD into the M.2 slot and then push and secure it down with a screw in the appropriate post according to the length of your SSD. <p> </li>

		<h3> <li> Installing the CPU Fan </li> </h3>
		Now to finish up installing our main components onto the motherboard, we want to install our CPU fan. First place a pea sized amount of thermal paste on the CPU. Depending on your heatsink and cpu, you may need to install another CPU bracket. To do this simply unscrew the 4 screws around the CPU and remove the parts of the old bracket. Then hold the new bracket in place whilst placing the new bracket on top and screw the fan down. Proceed to connect the fan cable to the motherboards CPU fan header. This is usually a 3 or 4-pin connector, and the port can usually be located near the CPU socket. <p> Note: Make sure not to over tighten screws and make sure to screw the fan down in a diagonal pattern to apply equal pressure on the thermal paste and CPU. </header><p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Motherboard into the Case </li> </h3>
		It is at this point that we place the motherboard in the PC case. However before you go ahead, make sure that the I/O shield is put in place and the standoffs are all in the appropriate places according to your motherboard. Failing to do so can result in a short which can damage your motherboard and components. <p> Now carefully lay the motherboard into the case, making sure to allign the ports with that on the I/O shield, and the motherboard standoffs. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Power Supply into the Case </li> </h3>
		Once the motherboard is in, we can move onto installing the Power supply (PSU). If you have a modular PSU make sure to get the required cables out ahead of time. it may also be easier to plug them into the PSU now. <p> Now place the PSU into the case, verifying that the fan on the top can intake fresh air. On most cases, the fan will be facing downwards. Then secure the PSU in place using the provided screws. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Graphics Card </li> </h3>
		Now we can install our Graphics card (GPU) if you have one. Find the closest PCIe slot to your CPU and push down the single latch. Before placing our GPU we will need to take out the required PCIe slot covers. After taking the slot covers off, gently place the GPU into the case, making sure that the GPU bracket alligns with the case and the PCIe connector alligns with the PCIe slot. Gently press down until you hear a click, indicating that the latch is closed. Afterwards you can screw the GPU bracket into the case. <p>

		<h3> <li>  Connecting the cables </li> </h3>
		Now that we've finished installing all of our components into the case, we can start connecting all our cables to our Motherboard and GPU. We'll start by connecting our front I/O connectors. Some of these are single pin connectors and can be quite finicky to plug in properly. What you could do to make this process a little easier is to get all the cables in the correct order and try to plug them in all at once. After you've connected all the front I/O to their headers, we can move onto connecting our PSU power cables. <p> We will want to route our PSU cables through the PSU shroud hole in our case to connect them to our motherboard. First we will connect our 24-pin atx motherboard cable. The port can usually be found on the right side of most motherboards. Subsequently we will connect our 8-pin CPU cable. This can most be found on top of the CPU socket. Thereafter we can connect our GPU power cables. Depending on the power of your GPU, you may need more cables or sometimes even none at all. Simply check the top of your GPU to see what kind of cable and how many cables you need. Then you can push the GPU power cables in until you see the clip on the cable go down. <p>

		<h3> <li> Powering on the PC </li> </h3>
		And now Finally, your build should be complete. The hardest part is done. But before reattaching the PCs side panels, turn it on to see if it works. If everything went well, the PC should spring to life displaying the manufacturer's logo and booting into the BIOS. If not, then check to see if all the cables have been plugged in properly, if the RAM is in the correct slots and if your HDMI or Display cable is plugged into your GPU and not your motherboard. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing the Operating System </li> </h3>
		To complete the system, you will need to install your Operating System (OS) of choice. Start by flashing your install USB with your desired OS. Afterwards, plug the usb into your computer and change the boot device to the install USB, from within the BIOS. After that restart the system and it should boot into the install USB. Go through the prompts and download the OS. Note: If the PC restarts after downloading the OS, take out the install USB to prevent the computer from booting to the install USB again. After installing, you should be greeted by the setup screen. <p>

		<h3> <li> Installing Device Drivers </li> </h3>
		Right, now your on your way to use your PC at last. However, once you finally load onto the desktop you may notice that your screen looks a little strange. This can be fixed by downloading the latest GPU drivers for your system from the official company website. While your at it, you may also want to update the bios of your motherboard and install your programs. Nanite is a very useful tool in this case, which downloads, installs and updates all of your applications quickly at once. <p>
